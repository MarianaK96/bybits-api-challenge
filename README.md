# By Bits Code Challenge

A completed technical challenge in which using a Policy API, a web application was created with a simple login screen which then directed the user to a policy details page.

## Tools

- React

## Notes

- Approximately 8 hours was spent on this, including the design for the project
- In future, I would make sure to push code consistently to my GitHub repo, having only worked on personal projects before this is still something I am getting used to

## To do...

- If I had more time to spend on this I would have liked to created an error message for when authentication was not successful
- I would have added some functionality to the 'forgot password' element
- I would have created tests to run
