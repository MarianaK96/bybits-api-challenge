# By Bits Code Challenge

A completed technical challenge in which using a Policy API, a web application was created with a simple login screen which then directed the user to a policy details page.

## Tools

- React

## Notes

- Approximately 8 hours was spent on this, including the design for the project
- In future, I would make sure to push code consistently to my GitHub repo, having only worked on personal projects before this is still something I am getting used to

## To do...

- Frontend / backend form validation needs to be added for email / password
- Error messaging to be added on login form for validation / server errors etc.
- 'Forgot password' element should prompt for reset, sending reset link to user
